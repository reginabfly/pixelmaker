# Pixel Maker Project

This pixel maker project was built utilizing HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. 

## About The Game

This game is a simple application that allows you to color the grid that you create with whatever color you choose from the palette. First the user chooses the height and width and then clicks the submit button. Then they choose their color and create their masterpiece. 

This project was originally done in jQuery and was responsive on all devices. For this project, I recreated it in vanilla JavaScript for extra practice. You can see the jQuery version by clicking [here](http://designsbyregina.com/pixelmaker/pixelartmaker.html).
